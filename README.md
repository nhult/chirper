# chirper

> Twitter-clone

# Why?
On my previous projects I've largely gotten stuck over design, but cloning Twitter allows me to implement a website, not re-design it. You can try the project here: https://nhult.github.io/chirper/

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
